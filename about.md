<img src="/images/profile.png" style="float: right; padding-top: 0px;">
I am Senior Software Developer with 6 years of commercial experience in a wide variety of web applications both client and server side. Currently I live in Poland, Wroclaw and I work for <a href="http://www.objectivity.co.uk/">Objectivity</a> - UK based company.

Programming and designing software is my big passion. Every day I follow two simple rules - [**Just Do It**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0) to overcome obstacles on the way and **Good Enough** to create software according to the best practices.

What is more, I really enjoy playing table tennis, swimming or ballroom dancing. 

I am [@matik12](https://github.com/matik12) on Github, and you can reach me at <a href="mailto:mateusz.korzel@gmail.com">mateusz.korzel@gmail.com</a> or via [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mateusz-korzel).
